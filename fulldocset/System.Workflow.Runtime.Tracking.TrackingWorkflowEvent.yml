  remarks: "> [!NOTE] >  [!INCLUDE[DeprecatedContent](~/add/includes/ajax-current-ext-md.md)]Uma instância de fluxo de trabalho pode passar por vários estados durante o curso de sua execução. Por exemplo, uma instância de fluxo de trabalho pode ficar ociosa, ou ele pode ser suspenso. Toda vez que a instância de fluxo de trabalho muda de estado, ele emite um evento de status do fluxo de trabalho para a infra-estrutura de controle de tempo de execução. TrackingWorkflowEvent enumera os possíveis tipos de evento de status do fluxo de trabalho."
